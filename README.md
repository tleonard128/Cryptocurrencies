# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning for data bootcamp

# Overview
In this exercise, I used unsupervised machine learning to fit crypto currency data to a model.

Note: due to an issue with jupyter notebook I had to write out a lot of the code in theory and was not able to run it.
Plan to come back at a later date to fix the environment issues.
